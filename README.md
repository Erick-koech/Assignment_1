Float vs Double
  Float-is a 32-bit floting point. Has 7 deciml digit precision after which it becomes less accurate.
  Double-is a 64-bit floating point. Has 15 decimal digit precision thus more accurate than a float.
  
Character vs String 
  Character-hold one letter or symbol (1 byte) e.g "B", "6"
  String-It is a sequence of characters, variable length and holds text.
  
#include <iostream>
  It tells the preprocessor to include the input/output stream library
  Gives you access to cin (console input), cout (console output) and cerr (error output)
  Without this, you can't do basic console I/O

using namespace std;
  std is the standard namespace where C++ standard library stuff can be located
  Without this line, you'd have to write std::cout, std::cin, std::string every time
  With it, you can just write cout, cin, string
